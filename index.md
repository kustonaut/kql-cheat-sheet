### Request Analysis
```kql
requests
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| summarize 
    RequestCount = count(),
    AvgDuration = avg(duration),
    P95Duration = percentile(duration, 95),
    FailureRate = round(100.0 * countif(success == false) / count(), 2)
by bin(timestamp, 5m)
| render timechart
```

### Exception Monitoring
```kql
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| summarize Count = count(), Sample = any(outerMessage) by type
| sort by Count desc
| take 10
```

### Performance Metrics
```kql
performanceCounters
| where timestamp > ago(6h)
| where category == "Processor" and counter == "% Processor Time"
| summarize AvgCpuUsage = avg(value) by bin(timestamp, 1m), computer
| render timechart
```
